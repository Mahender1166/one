        <h2>C (programming language)</h2>
        <p>The C programming language is a computer programming language that was developed to do system programming for the operating system UNIX and is an imperative programming language. C was developed in the early 1970s by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs.</p>
        <h2>Loop control statements</h2>
        <p> Loop control statements in C are used to perform looping operations until the given condition is true. Control comes out of the loop statements once condition becomes false. </p>

    
TYPES OF LOOP CONTROL STATEMENTS IN C:<p></p>There are 3 types of loop control statements in C language. They are,<br>
        1.for<br>
        2.while<br>
        3.do while <br>
        Syntax for each C loop control statements are<br>

<h2> EXAMPLE PROGRAM (FOR LOOP) IN C: </h2>
In for loop control statement, loop is executed until condition becomes false.<br>
<img src="C:\Users\S537240\563\projects\one\FOR.png"><br>

OUTPUT: <br>
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 <br>

<h2> EXAMPLE PROGRAM (WHILE LOOP) IN C: </h2>
In while loop control statement, loop is executed until condition becomes false.<br>
<img src="C:\Users\S537240\563\projects\one\while.png"> <br>

OUTPUT:<br>
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 <br>

<h2> EXAMPLE PROGRAM (DO WHILE LOOP) IN C: </h2>
In do..while loop control statement, while loop is executed irrespective of the condition for first time. Then 2nd time onwards, loop is executed until condition becomes false.<br>

OUTPUT: <br>
Value of i is 1 <br>
Value of i is 2 <br>
Value of i is 3 <br>
Value of i is 4 <br>
